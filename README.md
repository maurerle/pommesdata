## Introduction
*POMMES* itself is a cosmos consisting of a **dispatch model**, a **data preparation routine** (stored in this repository and described here) and an **investment model** for the German wholesale power market. The model was originally developed by a group of researchers and students at the [chair of Energy and Resources Management of TU Berlin](https://www.er.tu-berlin.de/menue/home/) and is now maintained by a group of alumni and open for other contributions.

If you are interested in the actual dispatch or investment model, please find more information here:
